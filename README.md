## Overview:
This project centers on the **development** of an advanced **machine learning model** for **loan status prediction**, utilizing 11 key features such as Loan Amount, Applicant Income, and Credit History to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, we have **deployed** an intuitive **web application** to provide users with an accessible and user-friendly interface for accessing loan status predictions.
## Tool Used:
* **Python** (*Jupyter Environmnet*)
## Key Highlights:
### Model Development:
* **Developed** a **machine learning model** for **predicting loan status**, addressing a critical business need.

* Comprehensive **data cleaning** and **feature scaling** were performed to ensure **data quality** and **model effectiveness**.

* **Conducted** a thorough assessment of three key machine learning algorithms: **Logistic regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree**, to determine the most effective model for loan status prediction.

* After a comprehensive evaluation, **Logistic regression** emerged as the **top-performing algorithm** with a **Accuracy Scor**e of **0.83** and an **F1-score** of **0.89**, solidifying its position as the best choice for this critical business task when compared to Random Forest and Decision Tree.

* **Utilized** a **column transformer** to combine all **feature engineering** steps and create a **pipeline** for **model development**.
### Model Deployment:
* **Deployed** the project using **Streamlit**, providing an **interactive** and **user-friendly interface** for users to assess **loan status predictions**.
 ### Model Evaluation
The model was **evaluated** using **Accuracy Score** and **F1-score**.
* **Accuracy Score: 0.83**
* **F1-score: 0.88**
